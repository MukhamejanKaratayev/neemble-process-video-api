    "summary": "The script is a conversation between two people. The first person took a picture of Mona Lisa on their phone and is excited to show it off. However, the second person tells them that just because they have the picture on their phone doesn't mean they own it. The conversation then shifts to owning cryptocurrency and the ability to sell it, and ends with a discussion about being honest. No video was described, so no video can be summarized."
